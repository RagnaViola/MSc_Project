function [ stim_num ] = first_item( matrix )
%FIRST_ITEM Determines the first item based on matrix
%   returns index of stimulus e.g. 4

probabilities=matrix(1,:) %just take the first row

thresh=rand(1) %randomly choose a number between 0 and 1

thresh_probabilities=cumsum(probabilities)      %bins

list=thresh_probabilities>thresh %check in which bin this threshold falls

stim_num=find(list,1) %returns index of stimulus
